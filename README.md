📝 Task Description – Titanic Dataset EDA
In this task, we perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore the relationship between passenger features and their survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

✅ Key Steps:
Loaded the Titanic train.csv and test.csv datasets.

Identified and handled missing values (e.g., in Age, Embarked).

Removed the Cabin column due to too many missing entries.

Created visualizations to understand:

Overall survival distribution

Survival based on gender, passenger class, and age

Analyzed correlations between numerical features to identify important factors influencing survival.

This analysis helps uncover patterns such as:

🚺 Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

💼 First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class.

👶 Children had a higher chance of survival compared to older passengers.
